# Gesture
A desktop UI overlay to enable typing functionality with the Gesture remote

The Guesture remote is a 3 axis gyroscopic mouse with scrolling functionality.

The purpose of this project is to create an app so that one may type using the Gesture remote (think on screen keyboard).

Later, features like settings or status readouts may be added.

The transparent overlay effect is derived from this video [Transparent Unity App! (Overlay, Assistant, Particles)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqgsGaMPZTw) by Code Monkey.
